## Context
<p align="justify">Rules and regulations are forever evolving. Keeping a company’s product range up to code can be challenging, especially when a key ingredient is on the verge of being banned.<br/>
In the light of the looming ban on PFAS in a variety of products, my team was tasked with creating a new industrial cleaner that was solvent based without any PFAS. I was voted CEO of our fictitious company, MissClean, and was in charge of leading the team to create a new formula and a sales pitch.</p>

## Company Strategy
<p align="justify">I decided to divide the company into three distinct teams as detailed below. The overall goal being to ensure that our product was ready within our tight deadline (1 month). I proposed weekly meetings where each team would present the different challenges they had faced, as well as their achieved goals.</p>

### The Technical Sales Representatives
 - Knowing client specifications
 - Knowing what apparatus the clients have
 - Details about prices 
 - Creating the sales presentation (end goal)
### The Regulations Team
 - Reading and providing a summary of new and pending regulations to the company
 - Defining PFAS and ensuring that none are present in the formulation
 - Creating HSE protocols and safety data sheets for the clients.
##€ The Engineers
 - Creating the product as per the Regulations and Technical Sales Team’s information
 - Finding the molecule to replace the usual PFAS in the formulation

## Key Challenges
### Deadlines
<p align="justify">We had a very tight deadline, especially considering that this was a university project that was done during classes, exams and other projects. Dividing the company into three teams meant that different parts of the project could be researched in parallel to each other.<br/>
The weekly meetings also meant that each member of the company was up to date with each team’s progress. This lead to smooth a transition when the final sales pitch was made.</p>

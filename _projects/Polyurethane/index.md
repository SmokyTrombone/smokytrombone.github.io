## Context
<p align="justify"> The flexible food packaging industry is very complex. A simple packet of crisps is made of multiple layers that must be bonded together. And each layer of adhesive can be unique within the packaging. To sum up, the fact that flexible packaging is getting more complex and robust means that the demand for ever more precise and innovative adhesives is growing. To answer that demand, companies such as Bostik have a plethora of polyurethane adhesives to propose.<br/>
In order to rationalise their product range and get a head start on future formulations, I participated in the application of AI to polyurethane adhesives for the flexible food packaging industry. I was initially only going to work on the chemistry side of the project, however I quickly asked to participate in the data science side to get a more global view of the project and hone my coding and data processing skills.</p>

## Key Challenges
### Complex Quantities
<p align="justify">I was applying a large number of tests to a considerable amount of products (adhesives, raw materials, packaging, etc.). The amount and complexity of these tests put my rigor and organisational skills to the test, especially when taking into account the fact that I was at Bostik for only one month at a time due to my university schedule.<br/>
To avoid any mistakes and improve my reporting quality, I quickly created clear and attainable objectives for myself and kept track of them throughout the year. Some more complex parts of the project called for a GANTT chart that I implemented without hesitation.<br/>
This organisation system not only simplified the exceptionally large task at hand, but also made it easier to add more aspects to the project on the go. When managing a team, I also find that creating shorter more achievable goals can increase morale.

### Improving Scientific Transparency
<p align="justify">I have always found that communication is key within a team and that communication also includes transparency. I have always  made a point of explaining my methods and calculations in sharded and personal documents. It helps keep everyone up to speed and makes things easier when onboarding new team members or changing methods.<br/>
I took the time to add details to a frequently used document within the team including methods, chemical reactions, and proofs. Furthermore, I took the initiative to demystify the AI side of the project for my fellow chemists. This helped create a better sense of belonging throughout the team. 
Finding Hypotheses  
A big part of the project was learning new things about the products. I found it difficult to find new and exciting hypotheses during my first few months on the team. Indeed, I was more focused on incorporating the current knowledge and didn’t have enough insight to take a step back and find new theories.<br/>
To counter this, I used my “free time” in between tests to read the on-site information about the products as well as research what universities and other companies are exploring around the same subject. My perseverance not only swiftly brought me up to the team’s speed, but also gave me the insight and knowledge to propose multiple hypotheses that were later tested.</p>

## Fast Mechanical Recycling Test
<p align="justify">During my apprenticeship, I participated in the development of a lab-scale recycling method to evaluate a packaging's recyclability. This project was an excellent opportunity to put my creativity and versatility to the test. I proposed 5 innovative recycling methods, graded them according to various industry standards and ensured that health and safety protocol was followed by creating a temporary occupational risks assessment document (DUER in French).<br/>
A particularly difficult part of this project was observing elements under the microscope. I was quick to bring my academic knowledge into practice by bringing different microscope techniques such as using dark field in order to see faults in the films easier.<br/>


### A New Approach to Data Processing
<p align="justify">In volunteering to work on the data science side of things, I was quickly facing a new set of challenges that I had never faced before. I was no longer working with spreadsheets, but large databases. I was also confronted to new Python libraries and elements that I had never worked with before.<br/>
Data science being a relatively new domain to me, I asked my supervisors for guidance in what skills and information I needed to be a productive part of the team. With a plan, I set out to learn what I needed. I also took the initiative of writing Python tutorials to help other apprentices or team members onboard this part of the project quicker.<br/>
In the end, I was chosen to visit the off-site data science team and discuss new theories and methods.</p>

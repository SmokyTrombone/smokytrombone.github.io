## Context
<p align="justify">Flexible food packaging surrounds us in our day-to-day routines in the form of crisp packets and packaged meat. A very important part of packaging is the sealing layer. This layer is in contact with the contents and therefore adheres to strict specifications and regulations. I worked with Bostik’s extrudable polyester product range for flexible food packaging for my apprenticeship in 2021. Once extruded and blown, the polyester becomes the sealing layer. The goal was to gain knowledge about the products at different stages of their life cycle. As an R&D technician, I planned and implemented a wide range of tests to characterise the products in different forms such as granules, extruded polymer and coating.<br/></p>

## Tasks
-	Determined extrusion profiles with Melt Flow Index (MFI)
-	Determined ideal sealing times and temperatures with DMA and design of experiments
-	Seal strength tests
-	Implemented sensory analysis tests (smell and taste)
-	Created a protocol in collaboration with US based team for fog measurement
-	Colour and haze measurements
-	Implemented tests according to client specifications
-	Created reports for internal use and for clients

## Main Takeaways
<p align="justify">As my first long term professional experience, this opportunity had me face a good number of challenges, both technical and human.<br/>
My curiosity and out of the box thinking often helped me go above and beyond what was expected of me. My organisation skills and my scientific rigor were also put to the test, especially when having to deal with planning months in advance due to academic absences.<br/>
Overall, my team and my manager helped me grow as a technician. My work and achievements left me wanting more. It was without hesitation that I continued onto my master’s degree, and with great pleasure that I continued working for Bostik during my course for the next two years.<br/>

title: Extrudable Polyster Characterisation
description:  <p align="justify">Characterisation of extrudable polyesters for the flexible food packaging industry. The goal was to gain knowledge about the products at different stages of their life cycle. As an R&D technician, I planned and implemented a wide range of tests to characterise the products in different forms such as granules, extruded polymer and coating.<br/>
This project was done as an apprenticeship within Bostik during my bachelor’s degree (“Licence Professionnelle”) in 2021.</p>

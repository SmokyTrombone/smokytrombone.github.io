## Context
<p align="justify">Flexible food packaging surrounds us in our day-to-day routines in the form of crisp packets and packaged meat. A very important part of packaging is the sealing layer. This layer is in contact with the contents and therefore adheres to strict specifications and regulations. I worked with Bostik’s extrudable polyester product range for flexible food packaging for my apprenticeship in 2021. Once extruded and blown, the polyester becomes the sealing layer. The goal was to gain knowledge about the products at different stages of their life cycle. As an R&D technician, I planned and implemented a wide range of tests to characterise the products in different forms such as granules, extruded polymer and coating.<br/></p>

## Task Summary
-	Determined extrusion profiles with Melt Flow Index (MFI)
-	Determined ideal sealing times and temperatures with DMA and design of experiments
-	Seal strength tests
-	Implemented sensory analysis tests (smell and taste)
-	Created a protocol in collaboration with US based team for fog measurement
-	Colour and haze measurements
-	Implemented tests according to client specifications
-	Created reports for internal use and for clients

## Key Challenges
### Adapting Health & Safety Rules
<p align="justify">I worked on this project in 2020 and 2021. The COVID-19 virus was still rampant and required people and companies to adapt. Smell and tastes tests were particularly affected and slowed down the R&D process. I collaborated with other teams that used such tests to design new temporary protocols that complied with the COVID-19 related restrictions.<br/>
This required a great deal of rigor and communication in order to make sure that all potential risks were considered.</p>
  
### External Reporting
<p align="justify">As a young scientist, it is undeniably easy to be over-focused on your experiments and neglect other aspects of a project. This showed in my reporting for people outside of the team as I did not give enough context for people to understand the intricacies of the project. My manager was quick to point this out and I immediately sought to get better. Today, I take pride in being able simply and clearly describe my projects and objectives. I have even been commended for making my work sound inviting to my non-chemist peers.</p>

## Context
<p align="justify">Paints and pigments surround us in the form of painted walls, coloured cars and even artwork. Aside from paint’s protective coating qualities, their aesthetic quality is one of their most crucial factors. The ability to quickly and efficiently colour match a sample is crucial for artists, professionals and DIYers alike.
Using solid pigments to add colour implies a time consuming and often tricky dispersion step. Pigment pastes are much easier to disperse into a formulation and can increase uniformity between batches as long as the pigment pastes remain stable. 
The aim of this project was to study the stability of different pigment pastes and determine a corelation between rheological properties and stability.</p>

## Task Summary
-	Implement aging test to pigment pastes stored at different temperatures
-	Sensory analysis
-	Rheological studies (viscosity, viscoelastic spectre)
-	Granulometry study
  
## Key Challenges
### Sensory Analysis Continuity
<p align="justify">An array of sensory analysis tests was carried out at three intervals: Day 1, 3 months and 6 months. The obvious problem of continuity, or ensuring comparable results came up quickly. To counter this, my team wrote detailed protocols for each test. In order to overcome the subjective side of such tests, simple but tangible examples were used to illustrate the possible outcomes.</p>

### Granulometry precision
<p align="justify">In researching the link between rheology and stability, particle size was a decisive factor. My university had a laser granulometer on site that we used to measure the dry pigment, in an effort to preserve the university equipment. The results were surprisingly large and varied, with measurements fluctuating between microns and millimetres.<br/>
With the apparatus at hand, we could not avoid particle flocculation, the phenomenon creating the aberrant measurements. We reported the problem to our partner company (Coloris) and brainstormed other ways to measure particle size. In the end, Coloris was able to measure the particle size present in the pigment pastes and stability prediction was feasible.</p>

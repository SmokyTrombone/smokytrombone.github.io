title: Storage, Stability and Rheological Profiles of Pigment Pastes - Correlation and Prediction Method
description: This project was a turored project done during my "Licence Professionnelle" in Castres. In partnership with Coloris, my team was tasked with determining the correlation between the stability and the rheological rharacteristics of pigment pastes.

skills: 
  - Sensory Analysis
  - Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
  - Brookfield
  - Precise Granulometry 
  - Stoke's Law
  - Aging Tests
  - Procotol Reaction

## Context 
The paint industry is a very big and varied industry. Paints and pigments surround us in the form of painted walls, coloured cars and even artwork. Aside from paintâ€™s protective coating qualities, their aesthetic quality is one of their most important factors. The ability to quickly and efficiently colour match a sample is crucial for artists, professionals and DIYers alike./n
Using solid pigments to add colour implies a time consuming and often tricky dispersion step. Pigment pastes are much easier to disperse into a formulation and can increase uniformity between batches as long as the pigment pastes remain stable./n
The aim of this project was to study the stability of different pigment pastes and determine a corelation between rheological properties and stability.

## Embedding images 
### External images
{% include image-gallery.html images="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52821641477_d397e56bc4_k.jpg, https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52822650673_f074b20d90_k.jpg" height="400"%}
<span style="font-size: 10px">"Starship Test Flight Mission" from https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/52821641477/</span>  
You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}

## Adding a hozontal line
---

## Starting a new line
leave two spaces "  " at the end or enter <br>

## Adding bold text
this is how you input **bold text**

## Adding italic text
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

## Adding ordered list
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

## Adding unordered list
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

## Adding code block
```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

```python
def start()
  print("time to start!")
```

```javascript
let x = 1;
if (x === 1) {
  let x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);

```

## Adding block quote
> A blockquote would look great if you need to highlight something


## Adding table 

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |

make sure to leave aline betwen the table and the header

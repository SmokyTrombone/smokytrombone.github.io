title: Storage, Stability and Rheological Profiles of Pigment Pastes - Correlation and Prediction Method
description: <p align="justify">This project was a turored project done during my "Licence Professionnelle" in Castres. In partnership with Coloris, my team was tasked with determining the correlation between the stability and the rheological rharacteristics of pigment pastes.</p>

skills: 
  - Sensory Analysis
  - Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
  - Brookfield
  - Precise Granulometry 
  - Stoke's Law
  - Aging Tests
  - Procotol Reaction

## Context 
<p align="justify">The paint industry is a very big and varied industry. Paints and pigments surround us in the form of painted walls, coloured cars and even artwork. Aside from paintâ€™s protective coating qualities, their aesthetic quality is one of their most important factors. The ability to quickly and efficiently colour match a sample is crucial for artists, professionals and DIYers alike.<br/>
Using solid pigments to add colour implies a time consuming and often tricky dispersion step. Pigment pastes are much easier to disperse into a formulation and can increase uniformity between batches as long as the pigment pastes remain stable.<br/>
The aim of this project was to study the stability of different pigment pastes and determine a corelation between rheological properties and stability.</p>
